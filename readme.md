#Cameron Pitt's Resume

Having entered the job market I found myself growing tired of trying to edit and
maintain multiple copies of my resume in Word. So like any developer I
turned to the proven tools that I knew best git, vim, and markdown. With git I can
maintain multiple branches, with vim I can edit quickly in an environment that I
am comfortable with, and with markdown I can create visual pleasing documents
with minimal markup.
