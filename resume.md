# Projects:

### 808Blogs.com -- 2006:
During my senior year in high school after seeing a rise in popularity of sites like
livejournal, xanga, blogger, and myspace I set out to develop my own blog
hosting and social networking site targeted specifically at Hawaii residents. The site
was built on a existing php platform called bloghoster, but I quickly found that bloghoster 
did not offer all the features I needed and so began developing modifications for bloghoster.
The popularity of these modifications eventually got me my first dev job working on the bloghoster 
platform.

### Textbook Comparison Engine -- 2011:
After disappointments with products received from two separate web-development firms and after Sherpabooks was disbanded I decided to create my own
textbook price comparison engine. Written in PHP my engine gathered information from various online retailers using SOAP and REST APIs where
available and page scraping when no APIs were present, and allowed users to search for and compare book prices from various retailers.
